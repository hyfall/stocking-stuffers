# stocking-stuffers
A java app to be used to randomly generate from a list of "Users" people to buy in a secret santa style of selection. Users will be unable to get themselves, or anyone on their list of Blockers - which must match exactly to the User name of the person they do not want to get. Using the Gmail API, the app will then email each individual who they are buying for.
